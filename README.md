Here's a basic code example for a real estate CRM in Python:
In this example, there are three classes: Property, Contact, and CRM. The Property class defines a real estate property with various attributes such as its address, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and price. The Contact class represents a contact, such as a real estate agent or a client, with attributes like name, phone number, email, and address.

The CRM class is the main class for the real estate CRM, and it maintains a list of properties and contacts. It has methods for adding new properties and contacts, as well as searching for properties or contacts based on various criteria.

The search_properties method takes in a city, state, minimum number of bedrooms, and maximum price, and returns a list of properties that match the criteria. The search_contacts method takes in a name and returns a list of contacts whose name contains the given string.


  Also we added an example of using psycopg2 to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute some queries for a real estate CRM

Finally a simple react UI:
This component defines a form with input fields for name, email,phone and address and a submit button. When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to a Python backend API endpoint /api/crm, passing the input data as the request body. The API endpoint can then receive the data and store it in a CRM database.
Adding another simple react UI component for the property inputs .

Bonus AI : This code loads a dataset of real estate data, performs some feature engineering, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model on the training data, evaluates the model on the testing data, and uses the model to predict the price of a new property.
